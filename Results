# Experiment README

## **Experiment Protocols**

### **Objective**
To investigate the impact of cognitive interventions (Tetris vs. Social Media Scrolling) on heart rate variability and task performance (logical and mathematical problem-solving).

## **Data Collection Protocols**

### **Participants**
- **Sample Size**: 33 participants (18 girls and 15 boys).
- **Demographics**: Participants aged 20-25 years, representing diverse academic backgrounds.
- **Recruitment**: Recruited via an open call and provided informed consent.

### **Phases of the Experiment**

#### **Pre-Break Phase**
- **Tasks**: Participants solved 10 questions (5 Logical and 5 Math problems).
- **Time Allocation**: Equal time for Logical and Math sections.
- **Monitoring**:
  - **Heart Rate (HR)**: Monitored continuously using a wearable device.
  - **Performance**: Task scores recorded separately for Logical and Math sections.

#### **Break Phase**
- **Intervention**:
  - **Treatment Group**: Played **Tetris** for 5 minutes.
  - **Control Group**: Scrolled **social media** for 5 minutes.
- **HR Monitoring**: Continued during the break to assess cognitive load reduction.

#### **Post-Break Phase**
- **Tasks**: Participants solved another set of 10 questions (5 Logical and 5 Math problems).
- **Monitoring**:
  - HR monitored continuously.
  - Task scores recorded separately for Logical and Math sections.

## **Uncontrollable Factors**

### **Boredom/Fatigue**
- Participants may have experienced boredom or fatigue, especially during the Post-Break phase.
- **Impact**: This could have reduced engagement and affected HR or task performance.

### **Cognitive Variability**
- Individual differences in cognitive abilities may have influenced both HR trends and task performance.

### **Distraction**
- Participants in the Control Group may have been distracted by the content on social media.

### **Stress Levels**
- Pre-existing stress (e.g., academic or personal pressure) could have impacted HR and task performance.

### **Device Calibration**
- Wearable HR devices may have introduced minor inaccuracies during data collection.

## **Results**

### **Heart Rate Trends**
- **Pre-Break Phase**: HR was elevated during the Math section compared to the Logical section due to the increased cognitive load of math tasks.
- **Post-Break Phase**:
  - **Control Group**: HR showed minimal recovery, indicating ineffective stress reduction during social media scrolling.
  - **Treatment Group**: HR showed significant recovery, confirming the stress-reducing effect of playing Tetris.

### **Task Performance**
- **Logical Section**:
  - **Control Group**: Scores slightly decreased compared to the Pre-Break phase, indicating continued distraction or stress.
  - **Treatment Group**: Scores improved slightly, suggesting better cognitive recovery and focus.
- **Math Section**:
  - **Control Group**: Scores showed minimal changes, remaining consistent with the Pre-Break phase.
  - **Treatment Group**: Scores dropped slightly, potentially due to over-relaxation following Tetris.

## **Conclusions**
1. **Cognitive Recovery**: Playing Tetris significantly reduces cognitive load and helps participants recover faster, as seen in HR trends and improved logical reasoning performance.
2. **Social Media Ineffectiveness**: Scrolling social media does not provide sufficient cognitive recovery, leading to sustained HR levels and reduced logical performance.
3. **Math Task Impact**: Both groups showed challenges in maintaining math performance, but the Treatment Group experienced a slight decline due to potential over-relaxation.

## **Recommendations for Future Studies**
- Incorporate more diverse tasks to generalize findings.
- Evaluate longer intervention periods to study prolonged cognitive recovery.
- Address uncontrolled factors like boredom and distractions using participant feedback and adaptive experimental designs.
